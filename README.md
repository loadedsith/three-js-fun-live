-This is the front end package. The backend is located here https://github.com/loadedsith/mysteryProjectServer-
The backend package has been depreciated in favor of MozVR support.

It has been revealed that the mystery project includes rift support via -node-ovrsdk- MozVR.

It has been pomised that the project will stay abstract.

That is all that is known about the project at the time.
